# Hyperparameter Optimization
In this project we see how we can optimize or tune hyperparameters of a machine learning model using various techniques and libraries like GridSearch, RandomSearch etc.

### Introduction
The main aim of this project is to understand the concept of hyperparameter optimization/tuning and implement various techniques in it using different libraries.
In order to achieve this objective we perform two tasks which are shown in the [Dataset](#Dataset) section

### Dataset
Datasets for both the problems are downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- For the first problem we use - [Mobile Price Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification)
- For the second task we use - [Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data?select=train_targets_nonscored.csv)

### Pre-requisites
Following are the pre-requisites for understanding this project
#### Technical pre-requisites
Techniques in hyperparameter tuning like Grid Search, Random Search and ensemble models <br />
Also, please refer to [Scikit-Optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/), [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) and [Optuna](https://optuna.org/)

#### System pre-requisites
Following libraries are required for execution of scripts in this project,
```
pip install scikit-optimize
pip install hyperopt
pip install optuna
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
```

### Usage Instructions
1. For task 1, you may run programs in `Mobile Price Classification/src`
2. For task 2, you may run programs in `Mechanism of Action/src`
